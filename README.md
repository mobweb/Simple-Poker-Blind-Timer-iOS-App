# «Simple Poker Blind Timer» iOS App

A fully functional iOS app using [PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com). Simply copy the files into a PhoneGap project and compile it to run the app yourself. Keep in mind that the code is a couple of years old and has not been updated recently. Since the app is free and still works quite well, I figured I might as well open source the code for someone new to PhoneGap (or web apps in general) to look at.

Since this was one of the first projects I realized in JavaScript, some of the techniques and practices used probably aren't perfect, but it should still be fun and informative to look at and play around with. :)

All of the code is documented right in the source.
